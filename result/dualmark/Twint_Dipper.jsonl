(PTIO)\n\nA bill on triple talaq in Assam has sparked off a controversy with several organisations including the Congress party accusing the Narendra Modi government of passing the bill out of a sense of \u201cfavor\u201d to Muslims. Opposition party Congress on Friday demanded an apology from the Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, accusing him of \u201cdodging questions\u201d. The bill has sparked off set of protest in various parts of the country. In Assam and Bihar, protests were held in front of Assam Assembly amid a shutdown. The bill, proposed in the monsoon session, seeks to prohibit a husband in Assam or his immediate family, including the wife and her family, from asking his wife to divorce him via an instantaneous message, email or telephone.

On Tuesday, Federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna announced a plan that her department will use to impose a series of regulations on top of the one the government agreed to in March. The challenge, she said, is to build on existing federal climate policies and also ensure that the country is on a path to achieve its goal of reducing emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2050. She listed four steps that would help Canadians reach those goals by 2028: A federal cap on greenhouse gas emissions; National reduction targets for CO2 per tonne - kilometre; A national framework for emissions reductions, with provinces committing to emissions reductions; And an integrated price on pollution. \u201cA national price on pollution is expected in the spring of 2028, which will reflect current market trends.\u201d"], "detect": [{"is_watermarked": true, "score": 5.74311978438127, "is_watermarked1": true, "score1": 6.030848532389, "is_watermarked2": true, "score2": 5.45539103637354}, {"is_watermarked": true, "score": 5.7579575220859525, "is_watermarked1": true, "score1": 5.830507581064426, "is_watermarked2": true, "score2": 5.685407463107479}, {"is_watermarked": true, "score": 5.209266975662028, "is_watermarked1": true, "score1": 5.716239381810131, "is_watermarked2": true, "score2": 4.702294569513925}, {"is_watermarked": true, "score": 4.287032581793656, "is_watermarked1": true, "score1": 4.06571699025015, "is_watermarked2": true, "score2": 4.508348173337161}, {"is_watermarked": true, "score": 3.347132979194229, "is_watermarked1": false, "score1": 2.569046515733026, "is_watermarked2": true, "score2": 4.125219442655433}]}}
