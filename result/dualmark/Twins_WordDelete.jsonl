{"text_original": " border. But I agree that when saplings are grown in a ground-soil type, the new growth is dense and straight-sided, and they will create a gully in the soil when heavily mulched in late fall. The ones planted by me are easily split, probably more than 3 in. wide when not divided, and they show the same characteristic when dug out this spring. My guess is that diascius will be used for a berry gourd and another fruit tree of tropical type not in the US, or for planting in new soil in heavily soggy yard. Or some fruit trees like grape fruit tree that has leaves covered up by a leafy plant, and diascii (as a ground-soul) will be used only for covering the leaves. You'll get close to one shade per one container (somewhere between 'tropical' and 'green', depending on the type of container). I was glad of that before.
