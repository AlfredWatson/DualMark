Among other things, Jose Antonio Vargas\u2019 story today makes that clear on a number of levels.\nOne is that people were willing to help him in a civilly disobedient way, starting with the woman at the DMV who whispered to him that his papers were fake rather than reporting him. Another is that whatever ultimately happens to Vargas, INS agents haven\u2019t rushed to his house to deport him ASAP. He\u2019s not currently sitting in a detention cell being questioned about what knowledge editors at the Washington Post and Huffington Post had of his immigration status. When Vargas pitched the story to the Post, they apparently rejected it, but they didn\u2019t turn around and immediately drop a dime on the guy.\nWhich is all just to say that the treatment of undocumented workers in this country is one of those things where we\u2019re only kinda sorta willing to enforce the law.

An interesting, related fact is that, despite all its efforts, immigration control has not stopped many (all?) deportations. In fact, what seems to be driving immigration control is the fact that the illegals refuse to stop committing crimes, both on and off the country\u2019s border. There are dozens \u2013 possibly hundreds \u2013 \u2013 of news reports each day in which these crimes are committed. Just recently, we got a report that an off duty Texas policeman attempted to stop a home burglary only to discover the burglar inside, who then evaded the officer and ran into a forest.\n\nWhat one needs to do to deal with gangs, drug trafficking, human trafficking, armed prostitution and any number of other crimes which involve illegals, is to offer a reasonable chance for legal aliens on welfare and the other assorted welfare programs, to join a system which actually requires a willingness to work, and with penalties", "As I alluded to previously, immigration reform seems to me like an issue where radical tactics, if people could be organized to engage in them, wouldAs I alluded to previously, immigration reform seems to me like an issue where radical tactics, if people could be organized to engage in them, would be necessary first. Immigration reform is not the issue itself: It\u2019s the framework under which those issues work as a whole.\n\nI can\u2019t think of a single political movement, for the last 50 years, in my lifetime, that has succeeded in advancing an even modest immigration reform effort even after a couple of years of organizing. That\u2019s because they\u2019ve either been overwhelmed by the opposition or the politics of the moment, and/or have been defeated by the forces they originally sought to oppose.\n\nWe in the Latino community want a comprehensive immigration reform bill. And we see that we can\u2019T wait for the political will to get there.
