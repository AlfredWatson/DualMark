Well, just bear with me.\nThis morning there were three pieces of legislation which came out of committee that would make it more difficult to challenge the authority of ministers. You will notice the addition of Commons rules to this list before looking too closely at them. Another rule is to ensure that members of the commons are free to vote for their constituents. In practice there is no such thing and very many MPs vote for their own particular party only. Those who vote from their interest in their constituents seem not to consider their own welfare if, for examples, they represent the south east but are in favour of a law in favour of broadband in every street. But it is, and has long been, what happens in private that makes for stories \u2013 and this story being the threat of an MP being recalled from election in order to vote directly on the referendum cannot leave much doubt that there is genuine paranoia in parliament about the potential of something, or someone", "text_attacked": {"rate_list": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9], "text_list": ["their foreheads which many do carry radios on their belts .
