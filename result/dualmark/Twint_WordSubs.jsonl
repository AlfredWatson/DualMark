{"text_original": " they orbit stars with at least a modest water budget in their atmospheres, which typically ranges from about 3.5 percent to 9.5 percent (depending on the size of the orbiting body, and its distance). But in a newly published study, scientists have proposed a simple metric that could tell scientists a bit more about whether a rocky exoplanet could have oceans.\n\nThe new metric\u2014called \u201cOrientation of Planet Earth,\u201d also abbreviated OBEP\u2014is derived from the angle, in degrees, with the Earth\u2019s gravitational axis, which sits directly above an object that orbits a star. If a rocky exomondo could be observed moving in front of its Earth in that direction, scientists could infer that its rocky surface, which could have formed by a series of impact events on its parent star, could have formed a water budget.
