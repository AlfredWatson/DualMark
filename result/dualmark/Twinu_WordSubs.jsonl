{"text_original": " a lot, Major League Baseball.com's top pick has been in that line since late February. As such the 19th annual amateur draft may not be anything to talk about. But that's where you go wrong. If you go to sleep this time, you could really miss him. If your team takes him in the top 10, that could even be more surprising.\nDeardorff's top draft prospect status, which the lefty pitcher's stock has held since last August's draft (and his subsequent high school graduation), was not affected by this month's international bonus period in signing, which saw a flood of U.S. players get offers in excess of a bonus that could top $3.5 million. If anything, that could help with the high school shortstop (he plays shortstop in college but can move to short if need be) could gain more traction. He'll be on an invite list, which can help in terms of being a priority.

{"text_original": " ros\u00e9s when the weather gets warm, etc. I don\u2019t do the whole seasonal wine snobbery either, which might get you called a snob. I love wines made at all times of year. So last Saturday, I went to see If You Love Wine by the great New Yorker foodie Annabelle Stevenson (review soon), but before I went, I bought a bottle of Cabernet Franc, which arrived yesterday, ready to open, which I did just moments ago. I love this cabernet, which is grown in parts of northern Europe, which can produce grapes so dark that they are not the right shade, which can yield some very intense, powerful wines. But they are so dark. That is how Cabernet makes it. If you do a cabernet tasting, which has become my favorite thing to do in the new millennium, do a red tasting (the whites) and a white tasting (the ros\u00e9s).
