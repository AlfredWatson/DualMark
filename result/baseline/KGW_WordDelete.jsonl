{"text_original": " a federal program that provides incentives to convert diesel vehicles into zero-emissions models. By authorizing $250 million a year, over 10 years, in Diesel Emissions Removal Allowance (DEREA) payments to companies that purchase zero-emission diesel vehicles, DERA will help bring approximately 4 million diesel vehicles off the roads and the market by 2027.\nThe DEREA program has historically been an attractive vehicle in terms of the benefits it delivers to consumers. DEREA offers an immediate $7,500 federal tax credit per vehicle purchased and offers credits to companies for developing and manufacturing zero-emmission engines (for example, Volvo and Honda) and batteries for trucks and buses. Moreover, DEREA incentivizes manufacturers to provide electric charging stations for electric diesel vehicle owners and allows those owners to qualify for DEREA credits through the tax credits they receive from the manufacturer for purchasing electric vehicles.
