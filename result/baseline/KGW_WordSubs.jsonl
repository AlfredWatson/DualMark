(If I were a rich man in my mid 40s, I would be too.) It took more than 50 years for Fleming to have his comeuppance and, in the meantime, his son sold books on the way to his death.\n\nStephen Hawking is a member of the Eminent Society of Physicists and Astronomers and he\u2019s written 17 books in all. His most recent, A Brief History of Time, released in February, is full of witty analysis of how space and time really work and his deep insights into theoretical physics.
