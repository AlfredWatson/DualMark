The jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict Read\nHer four young sons became a focal point in the trial, charged with harbouring his killer. The jury could not reach a unanimous decision on whether they had helped Omar Mateen, who shot and killed 49 people and wounded more than 500 others, in his quest for revenge.\nWhile the trial began Wednesday in the Florida capital, Tallahassee, Noor's lawyers said the jury reached a unanimous decision, but that Mateen's lawyers said that they had a case on his behalf and had yet to see the jury's findings.\nShe had told investigators the four young sons of Salman's family had helped her escape, with one of them, Sayfullo Saipov, killing a police officer as he attempted a high-rise car bombing on a Florida bridge.
